# ImageCreator
 The program turns an image into ...different image
## quick code overview: 
 Using the std_image library program resizes the image, then applies grayscale and converts the image to lines of characters.
 Next creates an html page with our "character creation" aka image.

### story: 
 I successfully completed the first semester of studies and just started the second.
 We had to choose which language we would learn from: 
 * c++ 
 * java  
 * c# 
 
 But as it turned out, to get a high grade you need to know all three...
 So practically this is my first time when I started object oriented programming with c++.
